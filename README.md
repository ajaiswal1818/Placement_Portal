Preface

The software is Developed on Android Studio 3.3.2 using Java and Google Firebase Database.

This software is Developed to make placement process easy and comfortable. GUI is made interactive by using several libraries and functions. The application provides common ground for Company, Student and Placement Administration to interact. Admin is the head of this system, every application request of students and company will be approved by him, admin will also allot time and venue for placement tests. Students and company will get the placement updates from the notices and notification sent by admin.

Hardware and Software Used for Developing




1. Android Studio 3.3.2 platform used for development
2. System Requirements
OS: Ubuntu

RAM: 4GB minimum

8GB recommended

Memory: 2GB of available hard disk

3. Google Firebase Database used
4. Advantages of using Firebase for App Development:

Real-time Database: Firebase has real-time and cloud-based database where you can store data in JSON and synchronized continuously to all connected clients.

Authentication: There are many apps that need identi_cation of a user to save user data in the cloud.
To provide an enhanced experience on various devices.

Hosting: Firebase provides fast, secure, static, and production-grade hosting for developers.

Storage: It is very useful when you want to create an app for storing and serving _les of users such and images and CV (for applying to the company).




DATABASE



Google Firebase Database is used as database.

UML Diagrams





Standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, business modeling and other non-software systems.

The UML represents a collection of best engineering practices that have proven successful in the modeling of large and complex systems.

The UML is a very important part of developing object oriented software and the software development process.

The UML uses mostly graphical notations to express the design of software projects.

Using the UML helps project teams communicate, explore potential designs, and validate the architectural design of the software.




















1. Class Diagram: UML class diagrams show the classes of the system, their inter-relationships, and the operations and attributes of the classes

Explore domain concepts in the form of a domain model.

Analyze requirements in the form of a conceptual/analysis model.

Depict the detailed design of object-oriented or object-based software.



















































2. Activity Diagram: Activity diagrams helps to describe the flow of control of the target system, such as the exploring complex business rules and operations, describing the use case also the business process. It is object-oriented equivalent of flow charts and data-flow diagrams (DFDs).


























3. State Machine Diagram: State machine diagrams can show the different states of an entity also how an entity responds to various events by changing from one state to another. The history of an entity can best be modeled by a finite state diagram.


4. Use Cases Diagram: Use cases diagrams describes the behavior of the target system from an external point of view. Use cases describe "the meat" of the actual requirements.

Use cases: A use case describes a sequence of actions that provide something of measurable value to an actor and is drawn as a horizontal ellipse.

Actors: An actor is a person, organization, or external system that plays a role in one or more interactions with your system. Actors are drawn as stick figures.

Associations: Associations between actors and use cases are indicated by solid lines. An association exists whenever an actor is involved with an interaction described by a use case.



































5. Sequence Diagram: Sequence diagrams models the collaboration of objects based on a time sequence. It shows how the objects interact with others in a particular scenario of a use case.
